# NanoMIDIControl
Simple midi controller project for Arduino using the Arduino Nano

Goals:
Simple, scalable, & stable midi controller platform.
Project designed around a midi keyboard instead of a MPC or knob/slider style controller.

Future goals:
Simplify the process of designing/testing synths & other musical equipment through midi.

Current Hardware:
Arduino Nano (I'm using a clone that works fine)
128 x 32 oled display over i2c
any type of button or switches
any type of potentiometers
diodes for button matrix
resistors for i2c bus
